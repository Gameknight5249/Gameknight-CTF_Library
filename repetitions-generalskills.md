 # Initial Observation: 
I saw that within the challenge, it said it was base64. One of the hints also said, "Multiple decoding is good." At that point I knew that there was going to be a base 64 code and I had to decode it multiple times; I just had to research what base 64 code was. 

 # Strategy (During the Challenge):
1. Open the file up
2. Research what base64 was.
3. Use an online decoder
4. Hopefully, find the answer after decoding it twice or thrice.
