## Challenge Summary üß©
You‚Äôre given a simple password-checking script and an encrypted flag that must live in the same folder. By reading the checker‚Äôs [`"source code"`](https://www.sonarsource.com/resources/library/source-code/), you can learn exactly what input it expects (often a plainly visible or deterministically derived string) and then use that to unlock the flag‚Äîno brute force required.

---

## Key Objective üéØ
Open the `"source code"` of the checker, identify the required password, then run the program and supply that password to reveal the flag.

---

## Prerequisites & Tools üîß
- Ability to create folders with [`"mkdir"`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jm7dpgtZKg)
- A text editor such as [`"nano"`](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-use-nano-text-editor/) to view the `"source code"`
- Python runtime to execute the checker with [`"python3"`](https://medium.themayor.tech/python3-command-and-control-how-to-guide-4fd4fe32ec71)

---

## Walkthrough üöÄ (with WHY)

1) Create a working folder and place both downloaded files (the checker and the encrypted flag) in the same directory using `"mkdir"` and your file manager or terminal.
**WHY:** Keeping both artifacts side-by-side ensures the checker can find the encrypted flag without extra paths or arguments.

2) Open the checker‚Äôs `"source code"` with `"nano"` (or another editor) and read through it carefully.
**WHY:** Directly inspecting the logic reveals what password the script expects and how it validates the input.

       Caption: The checker is open in "nano"; the validation logic is visible for inspection.

3) Locate the password in the `"source code"` (commonly stored as a constant or assembled from small pieces) and note it.
   **WHY:** Extracting the exact expected string lets you avoid guesswork and immediately satisfy the program‚Äôs check.

       Caption: The required password is visible within the checker‚Äôs logic and recorded for use.

4) Run the checker with `"python3"` and enter the identified password when prompted.
**WHY:** Executing the program with the correct input triggers its success path, causing it to decrypt and print the flag.

## Common Mistakes ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Forgetting to keep the checker and the encrypted flag in the same directory, which prevents the program from finding the file.  
- Skimming instead of reading the `"source code"`, which hides the straightforward path to the correct password.  
- Running `"python3"` on the wrong file or from the wrong working directory, leading to file-not-found errors.

---

## Lessons Learned ‚úÖ
- Reading `"source code"` first often reveals the intended pathway, saving time versus trial-and-error.  
- Small utilities like `"mkdir"`, `"nano"`, and `"python3"` form a reliable toolbox for organizing, inspecting, and executing challenges efficiently.
