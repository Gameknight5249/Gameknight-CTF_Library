## Challenge Summary 🧩
This challenge tests your ability to look past the rendered page and examine the site’s [`"source code"`](https://www.techtarget.com/searchapparchitecture/definition/source-code#:~:text=Source%20code%20is%20the%20fundamental,and%20other%20users%20can%20understand.) using the browser’s [`"web inspector"`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yK7Xecq2hHI) to locate a flag embedded directly in the markup.

---

## Key Objective 🎯
Find and copy the flag hidden in the page’s `"source code"` by inspecting it with the `"web inspector"`.

---

## Prerequisites & Tools 🔧
- Basic familiarity with [`"HTML"`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Getting_started/Your_first_website/Creating_the_content) structure so you can spot comments or inline text.
- Ability to open and navigate the browser’s `"web inspector"`.

## Walkthrough 🚀 (with WHY)

1) Open the challenge website in your browser. **WHY:** You need the live page loaded so all resources are available to examine with the `"web inspector"`.

2) Open the `"web inspector"`. **WHY:** The inspector exposes the page’s `"source code"` and files directly, removing guesswork from the visual view.

3) Go to the `"Sources tab"` and select the main page file. **WHY:** The `"Sources tab"` lists the files the page served; opening the main document lets you read the raw markup where flags are commonly placed.

4) Scan the file contents for a flag-like string (often in `"HTML"` comments or inline text). **WHY:** Intro web challenges frequently hide the answer in plain sight inside the `"source code"`.

## Common Mistakes ⚠️
- Only viewing the rendered page without opening the `"web inspector"`, which hides embedded details that are obvious in the file view.
- Skipping the `"Sources tab"` and expecting the flag to appear on-screen, even though the raw file view reveals it immediately.
- Scanning too quickly and overlooking a short comment or single line in `"HTML"` that contains the flag pattern.

---

## Lessons Learned ✅
- Opening the `"web inspector"` early gives direct access to the `"source code"`, which is often the shortest path to a solution.
- Checking the `"Sources tab"` for the main page file is a reusable habit for easy web challenges that hide information in markup.
