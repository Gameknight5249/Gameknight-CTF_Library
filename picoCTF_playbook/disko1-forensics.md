## Challenge Summary üß©  
This challenge provides a compressed [`"disk image"`](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/disk-image) and asks you to locate the hidden flag. The key skill is recognizing the `".gz"` file format and applying [`"strings"`](https://labex.io/tutorials/linux-linux-strings-command-with-practical-examples-422934) with filtering to extract readable data.

---

## Key Objective üéØ  
Use [`"gunzip"`](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linux-unix/gunzip-command-in-linux-with-examples/) to extract a [`".gz"`](https://cloudmersive.com/article/What-is-GZIP-Format-and-What-Risks-does-it-Pose) disk image and combine `"strings"` with [`"grep -i"`](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/grep-command-in-linux-usage-options-and-syntax-examples/) to quickly search for the flag.

---

## Prerequisites & Tools üîß  
- Familiarity with `"disk image"` handling  
- Ability to use `"gunzip"` for `".gz"` archives  
- Comfort with `"strings"` to extract readable text  
- Using `"grep -i"` to filter results  
- Understanding of [`"pipes"`](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linux-unix/piping-in-unix-or-linux/) to chain commands

## Walkthrough üöÄ (with WHY)

1. **Download the challenge file.**  
 **WHY:** You need the provided compressed disk image to begin analysis.

       Caption: Challenge-provided ".gz" disk image saved locally for analysis.

2. **Decompress the file using `"gunzip"`.**  
    **WHY:** The image is in `".gz"` format; extraction is required before scanning its contents.

       Caption: Successful extraction of the disk image using "gunzip".

3. **Run `"strings"` on the decompressed image.**  
    **WHY:** `"strings"` scans binaries for human-readable text, a common place where flags appear.

       Caption: "strings" output reveals readable substrings from the disk image.
       Caption: Once you use the "strings" command, you will realize why we use "pipe".
 
5. **Pipe `"strings"` into `"grep -i"` to search for the flag.**  
    **WHY:** Using `"pipes"` lets you filter `"strings"` output efficiently; `"grep -i"` ignores case to avoid missing matches.

       Caption: Filtered "strings" output via "grep -i" surfaces the flag.

## Common Mistakes ‚ö†Ô∏è  
- Not checking how to handle the `".gz"` extension first, leading to confusion before analysis.  
- Using generic editors like `"cat"` or `"nano"` instead of targeted tools, which wastes time.

## Lessons Learned ‚úÖ  
- Practiced extracting `".gz"` archives with `"gunzip"`.  
- Learned how to use `"pipes"` to chain commands for faster searching.  
- Strengthened understanding of `"strings"` for pulling readable data out of binary files.
