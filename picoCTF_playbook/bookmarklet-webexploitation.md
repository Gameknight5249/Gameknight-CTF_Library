### Challenge Summary üß©  
This challenge introduces the concept of a [`"bookmarklet"`](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-are-bookmarklets/), a small piece of JavaScript run directly in the browser. The task is to recognize the JavaScript code on the webpage, execute it correctly, and retrieve the hidden flag.  

---  

### Key Objective üéØ  
Learn how to use the browser‚Äôs developer tools to run JavaScript code directly and reveal hidden information.  

---  

### Prerequisites & Tools üîß  
- Basic understanding of [`"Inspect"`](https://zapier.com/blog/inspect-element-tutorial/) feature in a browser  
- Access to the [`"Console"`](https://www.debugbear.com/blog/chrome-browser-console#:~:text=The%20console%20is%20a%20developer,JavaScript%20code%20on%20the%20page.) tab in DevTools  
- Awareness of what a `"bookmarklet"` is

### Walkthrough üöÄ (with WHY)

1. **Open the challenge website.**  
   WHY: This provides the page containing the JavaScript code that hides the flag.

2. **Copy the JavaScript code from the page.**  
   WHY: The bookmarklet logic is visible on the site and must be executed to reveal the flag.

3. **Open the "Inspect" feature and switch to the Console tab.**  
   WHY: The Console allows you to directly run JavaScript within the browser context.

       Caption: Browser developer tools open with the Console tab selected.

5. **Paste the JavaScript code into the Console and run it.**  
   WHY: Executing the code simulates the bookmarklet‚Äôs behavior, printing the hidden flag.

       Caption: JavaScript pasted and executed in the Console, ready to output the flag.

6. **Read the flag from the Console output.**  
   WHY: The executed JavaScript directly prints the flag as the solution.

       Caption: The flag is revealed in the Console output after executing the code.

### Common Mistakes ‚ö†Ô∏è  
- Forgetting to open the Console tab and instead pasting the code in the HTML inspector, which won‚Äôt run it.  
- Not copying the full JavaScript code, leading to errors when running it.  
- Trying to manually guess the flag without running the bookmarklet.

### Lessons Learned ‚úÖ  
- `"Bookmarklets"` are small JavaScript snippets that can be run directly in a browser.  
- The Console in DevTools is a powerful way to execute code and inspect behavior.  
- Running provided JavaScript often reveals hidden flags in web exploitation challenges.
