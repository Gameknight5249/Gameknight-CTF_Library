## Challenge Summary 🧩
This challenge teaches how insecure client-side logic can leak credentials in publicly served assets. Using the browser’s [`"web inspector"`](https://wpengine.com/resources/how-to-inspect-a-website/) to review `"JavaScript"` sources reveals hard-coded login data that unlocks the page with the flag.

---

## Key Objective 🎯
Use the browser’s inspection tools to locate credentials in a client-side file and authenticate to retrieve the flag.

---

## Prerequisites & Tools 🔧
- A modern browser with `"web inspector"`
- Familiarity with locating files in the `"Sources tab"` within the `"web inspector"`
- Ability to read basic `"JavaScript"` 

---

## Walkthrough 🚀 (with WHY)

1) Open the challenge website.  
   **WHY:** You need the live page to load client assets that you’ll examine with the `"web inspector"`.

2) Submit a dummy username and password to the login form.  
   **WHY:** Triggering validation often loads or executes additional client files you can analyze next.

3) Open the `"web inspector"` and switch to the `"Sources tab"`. 
   **WHY:** The `"Sources tab"` lists all client-side assets (HTML, CSS, `"JavaScript"`) that the page serves; insecure apps sometimes place secrets here.

4) Scan filenames for anything related to auth and open `"secure.js"`.  
   **WHY:** Filenames that suggest security or login logic often contain credential checks; poorly designed apps hard-code test usernames/passwords.

5) Read the `"secure.js"` logic to find exposed credentials.  
   **WHY:** Client-side secrets are visible to every user; identifying them confirms an insecure authentication flow.

6) Return to the login form and sign in with the discovered credentials.  
   **WHY:** Verifying access connects your static analysis to actual functionality and should reveal the flag page.

## Common Mistakes ⚠️
- Only checking the HTML and ignoring `"JavaScript"` files in the `"Sources tab"`, which is where the credentials are exposed.  
- Skipping a dummy login first, which can prevent assets from loading and make the file list look incomplete.  
- Searching only in the `"Network tab"` and overlooking already served static files that are cached in the `"Sources tab"`.  
- Copying credentials with extra whitespace or quotes from `"secure.js"`, causing the login to fail even though the logic is correct.

---

## Lessons Learned ✅
- Client-side code is transparent to users, so storing secrets in `"JavaScript"` is insecure and must be avoided in real systems.  
- A systematic approach—trigger UI behavior, then inspect the `"Sources tab"`—efficiently surfaces authentication logic and other sensitive artifacts.  
- Practicing careful file scanning and verification strengthens your ability to spot common web misconfigurations in CTFs and real audits.
