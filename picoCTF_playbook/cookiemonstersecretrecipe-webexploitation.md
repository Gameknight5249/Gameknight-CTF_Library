### Challenge Summary 🧩  
Cookie Monster hid the secret in the site’s browser data. The core idea is to inspect and read the site’s [`"cookies"`](https://usa.kaspersky.com/resource-center/definitions/cookies) using the browser’s [`"web inspector"`](https://wpengine.com/resources/how-to-inspect-a-website/), spot a value that looks like [`"Base64"`](https://builtin.com/software-engineering-perspectives/base64-encoding), and decode it to reveal the flag.  

---  

### Key Objective 🎯  
Use the browser’s developer tools to locate, read, and decode cookie data to uncover hidden information.  

---  

### Prerequisites & Tools 🔧  
- Access to a modern browser’s `"web inspector"` (DevTools)  
- Basic familiarity with site storage like `"cookies"`  
- A [`"Base64 decoder"`](https://www.base64decode.org/) (online or local tool)

### Walkthrough 🚀 (with WHY)

1. **Open the challenge website.**  
   WHY: You need the site loaded to access its storage and cookies.

2. **Open the "web inspector" (DevTools).**  
   WHY: DevTools exposes application storage, including cookies saved by the site.

       Caption: Browser DevTools opened from the page.

3. **Navigate to the "Application" panel and select the "Cookies" section for the site.**  
   WHY: This is where the site’s cookies (key–value pairs) are listed.

4. **Trigger a login attempt by entering any username and password on the site.**  
   WHY: Some sites only set or update specific cookies after an auth attempt.

       Caption: Dummy credentials submitted to prompt cookie creation/update.

5. **Identify the value that looks like "Base64" (letters, numbers, `+`/`/`, and trailing `=`).**  
   WHY: Recognizing Base64 patterns helps you know what to decode.

       Caption: Cookie value highlighted that matches a Base64 pattern.

6. **Copy the cookie value and decode it using a "Base64" decoder.**  
   WHY: Decoding reveals the human-readable string, which contains the flag.

### Common Mistakes ⚠️  
- Looking through page HTML/CSS only and forgetting the storage panels in DevTools.  
- Skipping the interaction step (submitting dummy credentials), so the cookie never appears.  
- Misidentifying the "Base64" pattern and attempting to decode the wrong value.  
- Copying the cookie value with extra whitespace/newlines, causing decoding errors.

---

### Lessons Learned ✅  
- Cookies are key–value storage used by sites; inspecting them can reveal hidden data (WHY: many beginner web CTFs hide hints in client storage).  
- Recognizing Base64 patterns speeds up solving (WHY: quick recognition → quick decoding → faster path to the flag).  
- DevTools is essential for web challenges (WHY: the "Application" panel exposes storage you can’t see from the page UI).
