## Walkthrough üöÄ (with WHY)

1. **Connect to the challenge instance**  
   **WHY:** The server provides you with binary numbers and prompts you for specific operations.

       Caption: Connected to challenge instance via `nc titan.picoctf.net 56332`.  

2. **Read the first binary problem**  
   **WHY:** The prompt gives you two binary numbers and an operation (e.g., addition).

3. **Solve using a binary calculator**  
   **WHY:** While you could solve by hand, a calculator ensures accuracy and speed during a timed CTF.

4. **Read the second binary problem**
   **Why:** The prompt gives you two binary numbers and a bitwise operation (e.g., right-shift)

5. **Perform bitwise operations (e.g., right shift)**  
   **WHY:** The challenge mixes arithmetic and bitwise operations, so knowing both is necessary.

6. **Repeat for all given operations**  
   **WHY:** The challenge cycles through about six different binary/bitwise tasks. Completing each correctly progresses you.

7. **Convert binary to hexadecimal for the final step**  
   **WHY:** The last conversion unlocks the flag. Using an online converter ensures quick, accurate transformation.

## Common Mistakes ‚ö†Ô∏è 
- Misinterpreting bitwise operations (especially left/right shift vs arithmetic operations).  
- Entering results in decimal instead of binary.  
- Forgetting to include leading zeros when needed.  
- Skipping verification of results before entering them into the shell.  

---

## Lessons Learned ‚úÖ
- Binary operations are easier with a calculator during competitions, but understanding the theory helps avoid mistakes.  
- Bitwise shifts are not the same as multiplication/division ‚Äî always double-check.  
- Converting between binary and hexadecimal is a common CTF skill worth practicing.
