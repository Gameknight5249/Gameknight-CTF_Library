# Gameknight CTF Playbook

This repository is where I document my progress in cybersecurity through Capture the Flag challenges. It started as a place to store solutions, but over time it has turned into more of a personal learning system. Writing clear, repeatable guides helps me understand concepts at a deeper level than just solving a challenge once and forgetting about it.

The purpose of this repo is simple: track what I learn, explain each challenge in a way that makes sense, and build a consistent approach to problem solving in cybersecurity. Although I originally created it for myself, I also want it to be a useful resource for anyone who is learning CTFs and wants to understand the methods behind each solution.

## Why this repo exists

When I rushed through CTF problems, I usually forgot the details. Because of that, I began writing full walkthroughs with explanations, screenshots, and notes on mistakes I made. Slowing down forced me to think about why each step worked and helped me build a more reliable process.

Over time, I created a template that I now follow for every guide. It keeps everything organized and helps me focus on understanding, not just completing challenges. Since many beginners struggle with knowing where to start or how to think about CTF problems, I make sure the guides are written clearly enough for others to follow as well.

## What’s inside

This repository includes:

- Writeups for PicoCTF challenges across categories such as web exploitation, forensics, and cryptography
- Raw notes taken right after solving a challenge (picoCTF_fieldnotes)
- Polished guides rewritten using a consistent template (picoCTF_playbook)
- Screenshots and assets that show exactly what I did


## How I write these guides

Every challenge follows a straightforward process:

1. Solve the challenge on my own.
2. Take raw notes and record screenshots.
3. Review the challenge again to make sure I fully understand it.
4. Rewrite the guide using my structured template, focusing on clarity and reasoning.
5. Move the completed guide into the polished folder.

This system keeps each writeup useful long-term, both for me when I review concepts and for other students who want to see a step-by-step thought process.

## What this repo reflects about my work

The goal is not to create perfect writeups. It is to document how I learn. This repo reflects that:

- I work consistently.
- I try to understand details, not just solutions.
- I value documentation and clarity.
- I aim to build cybersecurity skills in an organized way.

At the same time, the guides are written so that other learners can follow along without needing advanced CTF experience. Anyone who wants to understand how I approached a problem can read the walkthroughs and apply similar reasoning in their own challenges.

## Future plans

I plan to continue adding more challenges, including those from platforms beyond PicoCTF. I am also working on designing my own challenge and setting up a structure for a school CTF event. As I improve, I will expand the guides to cover more advanced topics. I also want to make the explanations even clearer so they can help beginners build confidence in their early CTF attempts.

## Closing note

This repo is a long-term project. It shows how I think, how I solve problems, and how I try to improve through consistent practice. If it helps someone else learn how to approach CTFs or understand a specific technique, that makes this project even more worthwhile. At its core, this is a system I use to grow in a clear and organized way, and I hope it becomes a helpful resource for others too.
