**Directions:** If you want to hash with the best, beat this test! nc saturn.picoctf.net 52179

 # Initial Observation: 

The directions tell me to hash something, but I don't know what that means, so I have to research it. Other than that, I just have to connect and see what the challenge asks me to do

 # Strategy (During the Challenge):
 1. Research what ["hashing"](https://www.techtarget.com/searchdatamanagement/definition/hashing) is
 2. Play the challenge and hopefully use the knowledge of hashing to solve it
 3. Maybe use an online tool to "hash" text or other values that the challenge gives me

 # Tools Used:

[MD5 Decrypter/Encrypter](https://10015.io/tools/md5-encrypt-decrypt)

# Solution (What I Did During the Challenge): 
1. Connect to the challenge
2. Open an online ["MD5"](https://www.avast.com/c-md5-hashing-algorithm) encrypter to hash the strings the challenge gives you.
3. Plug in the answers to the challenge
4. Do this process three to four times
5. After three to four times with correct answers, the challenge will present you with the flag.

# Flag: 

After correctly using an MD5 hash on multiple questions, the challenge will present you with the flag.

# Mistakes I made:

I kept on half copying and pasting the string that the challenge gave me, thus I would get the wrong MD5 hash.
   
# What I Learned:

I learned to always work methodically and calmly; to not rush when I know I have almost found the flag, since it causes me to make silly mistakes.
