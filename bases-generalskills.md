- What does this bDNhcm5fdGgzX3IwcDM1 mean? I think it has something to do with bases.

 # Initial Observation: 
1. Looks like it's ["base64"](https://builtin.com/software-engineering-perspectives/base64-encoding).
2. I also have to add "picoCTF{}" before I submit the flag.

 # Strategy (During the Challenge):
 1. Decode the code using a base64 decoder.
 2. Add "picoCTF{}" to the answer.

 # Tools Used:

[Base64 Encoder/Decoder](https://www.base64decode.org/)

# Solution (What I Did During the Challenge): 
- My strategy was correct
1. Decode the code using a base64 decoder.
2. Add "picoCTF{}" to the answer. 

# Flag: 

- Once you decode the "base64" code, correctly format the flag and submit it.

# Mistakes I made:

- I did not make any mistakes.

# What I Learned:
- I learned that "base64" code does not need to end with two equal signs "==".
