**Date Started:** July 19, 2025

**Date Completed:** July 19, 2025

**Writeup Published:** July 19, 2025

**Directions:** 
Can you get the flag? Go to this [website](http://saturn.picoctf.net:51819/) and see what you can discover.

 # Initial Observation: 
  Looks like it's just a website

  The name suggests that the flag may be in the ["source code"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code) of the website
  
 The hints make me think that I have to use the ["web inspector"](https://wpengine.com/resources/how-to-inspect-a-website/) to view the "source code."

 # Strategy (During the Challenge):
1. Open the website
2. Open the "web inspector"
3. Click on the Sources tab within the "web inspector"
4. Hopefully, find the flag within it.
   
 # Tools Used:

"Web Inspector"

# Solution (What I Did During the Challenge): 
My strategy was correct:
1. I opened the website by clicking on the link provided in the directions
2. I opened the "web inspector"
3. I opened the Sources tab
4. I immediately saw the flag within the "source code"

# Flag: 

The flag is within the "source code" of the website

# Mistakes I made:

I did not make any mistakes in this challenge: I knew all of the concepts
   
# What I Learned:
I learned new ways to view the "source code" of a page
I learned that flags can be inserted within the "source code" without affecting its functionality.
