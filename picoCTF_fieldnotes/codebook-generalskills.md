# Challenge Name: Codebook

**Category:** General Skills

**Difficulty:** Easy

**Date Completed:** August 12th, 2025

**Writeup Published:**

**Directions:** 
- Run the Python script code.py in the same directory as codebook.txt.
Download code.py
Download codebook.txt

 # Initial Observation: 
 - In the hints, it says to keep both files in the same ["directory"](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linux-directory-structure/), so I should do that first
 - Looks like I might have to run the ["python"](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_intro.asp) file

 # Strategy (During the Challenge):
1. Download both files in the same directory (there is no need to create a new "directory")
2. Run the "python" file
3. This should give me the flag. 

 # Tools Used:

- I did not use any tools in this challenge.

# Solution (What I Did During the Challenge): 
1. Downloaded both files into the same directory
2. Ran the "python" file using the command ["python3"](https://medium.themayor.tech/python3-command-and-control-how-to-guide-4fd4fe32ec71)
3. I obtained the flag once I did that.

# Flag: 

- Once you download both files in the same directory and run the "python" file, you will receive the flag.

# Mistakes I made:
- I did not make any mistakes in this challenge. I have already learned all of the concepts and commands from other challenges

# Mistakes I Avoided: 
- I avoided the mistake of keeping both files in separate directories.
- I avoided wasting time reading the files. 

# What I Learned:
- I reinforced my knowledge of the command "python3"
- I also reinforced my knowledge that some "Python" scripts need external files in the same directory to work properly. 
- This challenge reinforces my pattern recognition for similar challenges.
