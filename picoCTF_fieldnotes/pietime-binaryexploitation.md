# Challenge Name: PIE TIME

**Category:** Binary Exploitation 

**Difficulty:** Easy

**Date Completed:** August 11, 2025

**Writeup Published:** August 11, 2025

**Directions:** 
- Can you try to get the flag? Beware, we have PIE!
Connect to the program with netcat:
$ nc rescued-float.picoctf.net 61471
The program's source code can be downloaded here. The binary can be downloaded here.

 # Initial Observation: 
- What is ["PIE"](https://ir0nstone.gitbook.io/notes/binexp/stack/pie)?
- Maybe I'll get a clue of what "PIE" is in the [binary code](https://www.coursera.org/articles/binary-code) or ["source code"](https://www.sonarsource.com/learn/source-code/), or else I am going to have to research it
- I think to solve this challenge, I first have to connect to it first and see what's going on

 # Strategy (During the Challenge):
 1. Connect to the challenge
 2. Research "PIE"
 3. Figure out a way to apply "PIE" so that I can solve this challenge

 # Tools Used:

- [Hex to Decimal Converter](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/hex-to-decimal.html?x=5E07596E333D)
- [Hex Calculator](https://www.rapidtables.com/calc/math/hex-calculator.html)

# Solution (What I Did During the Challenge): 
1. I connected to the challenge.
2. I viewed the source code and the binary code.
3. I then used the command ["gdb"](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linux-unix/gdb-command-in-linux-with-examples/) on the "vuln" file.
4. I then typed in ["disass"](https://visualgdb.com/gdbreference/commands/disassemble) to view the assembler code of the "main" and "win" functions.
5. I took the difference of the first assembly code for each function: the difference should be 96

6. Then I reconnected to the challenge: did "main address" minus "96" and got the "your input"
7. Once you enter the difference between the "main challenge" and "96" into the challenge, you will get the flag

# Flag: 

 - You will get the flag after you enter the difference between the "main address" and "96"

# Mistakes I made:
- When I was playing with the challenge, I noticed that if you typed in "x" as your input, the challenge would glitch out, and it would give you the input required: the difference between the main address and the "your input" was "19D". This was not the real difference, and I wasted a lot of time because of this glitch
  
# What I Learned:
- I learned the command "gdb"
- I learned the command "disass"
- I learned how to read ["low-level assembly"](https://www.ninjaone.com/it-hub/remote-access/what-is-low-level-language/)
- I learned about "PIE"
